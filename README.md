Final project for Python course

The main focus is going to be on what the maximum and minimum gas price average was for New York and the fluctuations of the prices. This is going to be analyzed using different New York regions and the state altogether.

The dataset used for this analysis is called Gasoline Retail Prices Weekly Average by Region: Beginning 2007. Prices were collected for New York State and sixteen of the state’s regions. Even though the dataset begins in 2007, some regions weren’t collected till 2017. The data was therefore cleaned so each column started from 1/16/2017 since there was no data for some of those regions before that date. 

Another dataset I found had similar results as the dataset I used for my research. This dataset was called Weekly Average Motor Gasoline Prices. The difference was that the data collected was only for this year and last year. It was also collected from the state as a whole and the upper part of New York. They compared the current prices to last year’s prices to determine the percent change between the prices of gas. 

For each graph I coded I focused on what would be needed first. The first thing I coded in was the downloaded dataset. I then printed the columns and info that are in this dataset to code the graphs easier. I also calculated the mean, median, and mode of the data for the New York State as a whole. Once that was done, I was able to start my first plotted line graph. The first graph is the average gas price for New York state as a whole. It starts from 5/2/2022 and goes till 1/16/2017. After the plotted line for the whole state was done, I created a second plotted graph for each of the regions. The next graph contained both the data from the whole state and the singular regions. I made a scatter plot to show the trend where the regions data would match up with the whole state. I made the regions diamonds and the state stars so it was easier to determine. I then made my histogram of the data to see of New York state what prices appeared the most and then a box and whisker plot which used the mean, median, and mode that was calculated in the beginning. 

The first two graphs are line graphs, one for New York State and one for the regions in New York. These showed the fluctuations that took place starting at 5/2/2022 and going down to 1/16/2017. The next graph combined both graph datas to view how the regions correlated with the state average in a scatter plot. After that, a histogram was created to view which prices were seen the most or the least in the data collected. The last graph is a box and whisker plot, which shows the New York state average gas price maximum, maximum outliers, minimum, median, and 1st and 2nd quartiles of the data collected. 

I feel the analysis was successful in showing the rise and fall in gas prices from 2017 to 2022. It actually showed how the prices have been steadily rising over the past few years. What was interesting was that for a while the prices were very low and only spiked fairly recently starting in 2022.
